In North America, the series has been streamed on Crunchyroll, Funimation and Hulu. Attack on Titan has also aired on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in the United States.
    As one of the best studios in the anime industry, Wit Studio is responsible for some of the most iconic series ever, despite its recent founding in 2012.
